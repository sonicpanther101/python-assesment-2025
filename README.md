### Assessment: Restaurant Meal Ordering System  

#### **Achieved Requirements**  

##### **1. Program Functionality**  
- **Menu Display:**
  - The program displays 5 menu items with images, names, and prices using the `itemDisplay` class.
  - Example: `ITEMS` list contains all menu data.
- **Order Input:**
  - Users can add/remove items (max 5 per item) with `+`/`-` buttons. Quantities are tracked in the `cart` dictionary.
- **Order Calculation:**
  - Subtotal, tax (15%), and total are calculated dynamically in `checkoutPage()`.
- **Output:**
  - Order summary shows itemized costs, quantities, subtotal, tax, and total.
- **GUI Interface:**
  - Built with `customtkinter` (modern TKinter). Includes buttons, labels, images, and reactive elements.

##### **2. Code Execution**  
- **Runnable Code:**
  - Executes via `app.mainloop()` and requires `customtkinter` and `PIL` pip packages.
- **Python Fundamentals:**
  - Uses classes, functions, loops, and conditional logic.

##### **3. Task-Specific Features**  
- **OOP Design:**
  - Classes: `item`, `button`, `itemDisplay`, `reactiveLabel`, `label`, `itemWidget`.
- **Constants:**
  - `ITEMS` (menu data), and `ITEMS_INDEX` (item-position mapping).
- **Comments:**
  - Key sections documented (e.g., `# Represents a menu item...`).

##### **4. Object-Oriented Programming**  
- **Classes & Instances:**
  - 6 classes defined with instances created (e.g., `button("Back", ...)`).
- **Attributes/Methods:**
  - `item` has `name`, `price`, `image` and `itemWidget` updates button states with `updateButtonState()`.
- **Interactions:**
  - `itemWidget` uses `itemDisplay`, `button`, and `reactiveLabel`.

##### **5. GUI Implementation**  
- **Widgets:**
  - `CTkButton`, `CTkLabel`, `CTkImage` for modern UI.
- **Event Handling:**
  - Button clicks trigger `addToCart()`/`removeFromCart()` and `StringVar` traces update UI dynamically.

##### **6. Data Structures**  
- **Lists & Dictionaries:**
  - `ITEMS` (list of `item` objects), `cart` (dictionary tracking quantities).

##### **7. Input Validation**  
- **Boundary Checks:**
  - `addToCart()`/`removeFromCart()` enforce `0 <= quantity <= 5`.
- **Button States:**
  - `+`/`-` buttons disabled at limits (greyed out with `updateButtonState()`).

##### **8. Clear Code Layout**  
- **Organization:**
  - Imports > Constants > Classes > Functions > Main execution.
- **Comments & Spacing:**
  - Logical sections separated with descriptive names (e.g., `checkoutPage`).

##### **9. Testing**
- **Bugs Fixed**
  - Traces not being removed when returning to the `orderPage()` from the `checkoutPage()`. This led to the `cartText` variable being reinitialised in the `clearPage()` function.
  - Row of new items not being correct. This led to the addition of the `row` global variable.
- **Expected Cases:**
  - Adding/removing items, calculating totals, navigating pages (order â†” checkout).
- **No Critical Bugs:**
  - Handles max/min quantities. No crashes during operations.

#### **Merit Requirements**  

##### **1. Apropriate Naming**  
- **Descriptive Names:**
  - `reactiveLabel` (auto-updating label), `itemWidget` (item control panel).
- **Organized Comments:**
  - Explains class roles (e.g., `# Tracks quantities...`) and critical logic.

##### **2. Conventions**  
- **PEP 8 Adherence:**
  - Classes (`CamelCase`), variables (`snake_case`), 4-space indents.

##### **3. Organized Testing**  
- **Boundary Cases:**
  - Tested: Adding 6th item (blocked with disabled button), removing from 0 (blocked with disabled button), empty cart (disables checkout button).
- **Expected Cases:**
  - Multi-item orders, tax calculation, navigation.
- **Debugging:**
  - Button state function (`updateButtonState()`) fixes the bug where the buttons are not disabled at their min and max values.
    - Identified when buttons were not disabled when they should have been.
    - To fix this bug I moved around the `updateButtonState()` function until I found that the scope of the function was the problem.
    - Moving it to within the `__init__()` function of the `itemWidget` class fixed the bug.
  - Traces not being removed when returning to the `orderPage()` from the `checkoutPage()`. This was fixed with the `cartText` variable being reinitialised in the `clearPage()` function.
    - Identified when returning to the `orderPage()` was super slow.
    - Read console logs and found it was caused by the traces attatched to the list of `StringVar`s.
    - Tried removing the traces, but that didn't work.
    - Fixed by reinitialising the `cartText` variable in the `clearPage()` function.
  - Row of new items not being correct from manual row input. This was fixed with the addition of the `row` global variable.
  - Widgets were taking up the same cell in the GUI.
  - Row position determines the y value of widgets.
  - Fixed by adding a global `row` variable which keeps track of what row the GUI is up to when adding widgets. This is added to whenever the program sees fit to go to the next row, a much better solution than manualy adding to the row variable.

#### **Excellence Requirements**  

##### **1. Well-Structured & Logical**  
- **OOP Modularity:**
  - Entities: `item` (menu item), GUI classes (encapsulate widgets).
- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Business logic (cart/calculations) separate from GUI (`orderPage()`, `checkoutPage()`).
- **Control Flow:**
  - Event-driven flow (button clicks > cart updates > UI refresh).

##### **2. Code Organisation and Readability**
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:**
  - Adheres to the PEP 8 standard
- **Logical grouping of code:**
  - Imports > Constants > Classes > Functions > Main execution.
- **Comments:**
  - Comments are only when code is confusing or describing a function of class, which makes them effective and not overused.

##### **3. Flexibility & Robustness**  
- **Flexibility:**
  - Add/remove menu items by updating `ITEMS` (no GUI code changes needed).
  - `TAX_RATE` easily modified (constant used in `checkoutPage()`).
- **Robustness:**
  - **Input Validation:** Buttons prevent invalid states (no manual input errors).
  - **Edge Cases:** Handles max items, empty cart, and negative quantities.
  - **User Feedback:** Buttons grey out at limits. Checkout disabled for empty cart.

##### **4. Comprehensive Testing**  
- **Test Cases:**
  | **Scenario**               | **Test**                          | **Result**                     |  
  |----------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|  
  | **Normal Order**           | Add 2 hamburgers, 1 fries         | Correct subtotal/tax/total     |  
  | **Max Quantity**           | Add 5 soft drinks > try 6th       | Blocked at 5                   |  
  | **Empty Cart**             | Attempt checkout with no items    | Checkout button disabled       |  
  | **Item Removal**           | Remove from 0 quantity            | Blocked with disabled button       |  
  | **Navigation**             | Order > Checkout > Back > Order   | Pages reset correctly          |  
- **Debugging:**
  - Fixed initial state issues with `clearPage()` (resets cart/widgets).
  - Traced `StringVar` to sync cart quantities and UI.
- **Output Clarity:**
  - Order summary formats prices (e.g., `$4.50`), aligns columns.
